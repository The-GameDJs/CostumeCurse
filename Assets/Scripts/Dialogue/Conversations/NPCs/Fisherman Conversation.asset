      here!
  - Character: Sield
    text: What's that over there?
  - Character: Fisherman Raggy
    text: That's the Village of the Unspoken, where I'm from. Long ago, we looked
      just like you but we were cursed by The Great Pumpkin.
  - Character: Ganiel
    text: ' Why?'
  - Character: Fisherman Raggy
    text: No one remembers, unfortunately. I guess that's part of the curse...
  - Character: Sield
    text: Maybe we could find a way to bring you back to normal?
  - Character: Fisherman Raggy
    text: Please don't bother... The Great Pimpkin and its armies are too powerful
      for you two. Find your way home and don't come back.
