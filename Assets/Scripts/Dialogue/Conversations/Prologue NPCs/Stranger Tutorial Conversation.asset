    text: Greetings my children. Are you lost?
  - Character: Ganiel
    text: Y-yes.. where <shaky>ARE WE?!?</shaky>
  - Character: Stranger
    text: You are in the Forgotten Forest, where many children have been long lost
      and forgotten. The witch transported you here for not being in the Halloween
      Spirit!
  - Character: Sield
    text: Well I guess we deserved that...Who are you anyway? Why are we wearing
      these <shaky>costumes??</shaky>
  - Character: Stranger
    text: I am...the Stranger. I've been wandering this strange land for hundreds
      of years.
  - Character: Stranger
    text: 'I guide lost souls just like you. '
  - Character: Sield
    text: So how do we make it out? Why can't you get us home, if you know this place
      so well?
  - Character: Stranger
    text: <tiny>You must complete the path on your own, my little children. I am
      getting too old to help you on your adventurous quest...</tiny>
  - Character: Stranger
    text: The forest has been overrun by the evil Skeletoodles and Pimpkins. I am
      the sole survivor of this place.
  - Character: Ganiel
    text: S-skeletoodles? <shaky>PIMPKINS??</shaky>
  - Character: Sield
    text: Why was the forest overrun?
  - Character: Stranger
    text: I wish I had the answer, little one...but you two seem special.
  - Character: Stranger
    text: I sense some intruiging power within your costumes. The witch has given
      you a gift and a curse...take these candies.
  - Character: Stranger
    text: They will come in handy throughout your journey. Use it wisely against
      what lies ahead...I would not eat them if I were you.
  - Character: Ganiel
    text: Well, at least we finally got some candy Sield...And what about you? What
      will you do?
  - Character: Stranger
    text: My time has come to an end, my child...I do not have the energy to guard
      this place anymore.
  - Character: Stranger
    text: They are coming...Now go! Face them. Save my people. Save the world and
      go home!
